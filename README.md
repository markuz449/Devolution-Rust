<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a recreation of a full year project I was apart of that was originally created in C. The stipulations for the project was that it had to be cool and less than 1000 lines of code. I've decided to recreate it in Rust because I wasn't happy with the final release of the original product.
